# Glossary

## active high

When the signal is high, the logic is high.

## active low

When the signal is low, the logic is high. This is commonly represented with an overline.

## asynchronous serial communications protocol

A communications protocol in which data is transmitted bit-by-bit over a channel and is not synchronized using an external clock signal.

## conductor

A material through which charge can easily flow.

## daisy chain configuration

A configuration in which the output of one component is the input of another component for all components in the configuration.

## dual in-line package

Also called DIP for short, a type of component package with rectangular housing and metal legs coming out the sides so that it can be mounted on a PCB or put in a DIP socket. Often said to look like a bug.

## full duplex

A mode in which communication is allowed in both directions simultaneously.

## half duplex

A mode in which communication is only allowed in one direction at a time.

## IC

An integrated circuit.

## main-sub model

A model where a primary "main" device or process controls one or more secondary "sub" devices or processes. This is also known as "primary-secondary," "leader-worker," "controller-device," "master-slave" (deprecated), or any other similar language.

## multidrop configuration

A configuration in which all components are connected discretely.

## shift register

A circuit that can receive data in serial and then output to multiple pins in parallel.

## synchronous serial communications protocol

A communications protocol in which data is transmitted bit-by-bit over a channel and is synchronized using an external clock signal.
