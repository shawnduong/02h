## conductor

## full duplex

A mode in which communication is allowed in both directions simultaneously.

## half duplex

## synchronous serial communications protocol

A communications protocol in which data is transmitted bit-by-bit over a channel and is synchronized using an external clock signal.

## asynchronous serial communications protocol

A communications protocol in which data is transmitted bit-by-bit over a channel and is not synchronized using an external clock signal.

## main-sub model
