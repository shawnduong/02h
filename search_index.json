This is as opposed to a daisy chain configuration in which all CS lines would be shared and the main and subs would daisy chain their MISO and MOSI lines together in a ring. However, not all main and sub devices support daisy chaining.\nThe CS is responsible for enabling a sub to communicate with the main. CS may be seen written as CS, which denotes that it is active low rather than active high. When the main wants to communicate with a sub, the main will select the sub using their CS line.\nIf either the sub or main require a waiting time after CS as per their spec sheet, then the main must wait for that much time. The main will generate a clock signal through SCLK, and then the main and sub will communicate in full duplex mode through MOSI and MISO where one bit is transferred each clock cycle.\nSCLK\nThe main is responsible for generating the SCLK signal at a frequency supported by the sub it is trying to communicate with. The SCLK should not exceed the sub's maximum clock speed, as per the sub's spec sheet.\nThe main and sub can use the SCLK to output and sample bits in different ways based on how they've defined the clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA) options:\n\n\n\nCPOL\nSCLK Idles At\n\n\n\n\n0\nLogical low voltage\n\n\n1\nLogical high voltage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPHA\nBits Outputted When SCLK\nBits Sampled When SCLK\n\n\n\n\n0\ntransitions TO idle\ntransitions FROM idle\n\n\n1\ntransitions FROM idle\ntransitions TO idle\n\n\n\nSPI Modes\nIn order for the main and sub to communicate, the main must match its CPOL and CPHA with the sub's, following the sub's spec sheet. The combination of CPOL and CPHA results in 4 SPI operating modes:\n\n\n\nSPI Mode\nCPOL\nCPHA\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n\n3\n1\n1\n\n\n\nSPI in Development Boards\nIn common development and prototyping boards such as Arduinos and NodeMCUs, there are already pins for SPI communication.\nArduino Uno:\n\nNodeMCU:\n\nNote that in the NodeMCU, there are SPI and HSPI pins shown on the left and right of the board pinout figure, respectively. As per the NodeMCU documentation, one should use the HSPI for communication with peripherals; the other SPI pins are used for communicating with the flash chip on development boards with flash functionality.\nAlthough development boards commonly have dedicated CS pins, any digital pin can actually be used as long as it can output a high or low signal. If there aren't enough pins to spare, other solutions such as multiplexing or using shift registers may be employed to extend the maximum number of subs that can be selected. If the components support it, one can also use a daisy chain configuration to conserve pins.\n"},"hardware/ics/":{"url":"hardware/ics/","title":"Integrated Circuits","keywords":"","body":"Integrated Circuits\nIntegrated circuits, colloquially called \"chips,\" are small electronic devices containing a combination of electronic components integrated onto a single semiconductor.

An electric circuit is a closed pathway or loop that allows electric charge to flow from one point to another. It consists of various electrical components, such as wires, resistors, capacitors, inductors, switches, and more, connected in a specific arrangement.\nIn order to understand electricity and electrical circuits, there are a few basic concepts to grasp.\nElectric Charge\nAn electric charge is the fundamental property of matter that results from an imbalance in the number of negatively charged electrons and positively charge protons within an object. Objects can carry a positive, negative, or neutral charge depending on the balance of electrons and protons.\nElectric charges alone produce electric fields, and moving electric charges additionally produce magnetic fields.\nElectric charge is measured in units of coulombs (CCC), which is defined as the amount of charge 1 amp delivers in 1 second. It is equal to the charge of 6.242×10186.242 \\times 10^{18}6.242×1018 electrons.\nVoltage\nVoltage, often referred to as electric potential or electromotive force (EMF), is a measure of the difference in potential energy between two points.\nVoltage is measured in volts (VVV) and is the force that causes electric charges to move in a circuit.\nCurrent\nElectric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor.\nBy convention, current is said to flow from points of higher voltage to points of lower voltage. In actuality, electrons flow in the opposite direction, but conventional current flow remains the convention used by scientists and engineers today.\nCurrent is measured in amperes (AAA, also called amps) and represents the rate at which charge moves through a circuit.\nResistance\nResistance is the property of a material to oppose the flow of electric current.\nResistance is measured in units of ohms (Ω\\OmegaΩ) and represents how much opposition is present against a current.\n"},"hardware/ics/555.html":{"url":"hardware/ics/555.html","title":"555","keywords":"","body":"555\nThe 555 timer IC is a timer created by Signetics (Philips, aka NXP).\nThere are many variations of the 555 timer IC.

When voltage on TRIG falls below 1/3 VCC, OUT will go to a high state and will remain in that high state so as long as TRIG stays at that low voltage.\nOUT: output pin that outputs the signal generated by the timer, where the signal switches between VCC voltage and GND voltage.\nRESET: when the reset pin is pulled low, the timer resets. If this is unused, it should be connected to VCC.\nCTRL: control voltage pin that provides access to the internal voltage divider. By applying an external CTRL voltage, one can change the width of the OUT signal. If CTRL is unused, it should be connected to GND with a 10 nF capacitor.\nTHR: threshold voltage pin. When THR > 2/3 VCC, OUT goes from a high to a low state.\nDIS: discharge to GND pin for the external timing capacitor during the discharge phase of the timing cycle.\nVCC: input voltage.
