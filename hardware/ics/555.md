# 555

The 555 timer IC is a timer created by Signetics (Philips, aka NXP).

There are many variations of the 555 timer IC. The most common is the NE* variation, which is the original version of the 555.

## Pinout

The pinout of the 555 looks like so:

1. GND: ground, or reference voltage.
2. TRIG: trigger pin. When voltage on TRIG falls below 1/3 VCC, OUT will go to a high state and will remain in that high state so as long as TRIG stays at that low voltage.
3. OUT: output pin that outputs the signal generated by the timer, where the signal switches between VCC voltage and GND voltage.
4. <span style="text-decoration:overline">RESET</span>: when the reset pin is pulled low, the timer resets. If this is unused, it should be connected to VCC.
5. CTRL: control voltage pin that provides access to the internal voltage divider. By applying an external CTRL voltage, one can change the width of the OUT signal. If CTRL is unused, it should be connected to GND with a 10 nF capacitor.
6. THR: threshold voltage pin. When THR > 2/3 VCC, OUT goes from a high to a low state.
7. DIS: discharge to GND pin for the external timing capacitor during the discharge phase of the timing cycle.
8. VCC: input voltage. For NE555 timers, this is defined as anywhere from 4.5 V to 16 V.

## Operating Modes

The 555 has 3 primary operating modes:
1. Astable
2. Monostable
3. Bistable

### Astable

In astable mode, the 555 operates as an oscillator.

The 555 in astable mode can act as an oscillator to generate rectangle waves with an adjustable duty cycle and adjustable frequency.

### Monostable

In monostable mode, the 555 operates as a one-shot pulse generator.

### Bistable

In bistable mode, the 555 operates as a set-reset latch.
