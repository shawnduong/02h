# Boards

Boards, also known as printed circuit boards (PCBs), are flat boards of insulating material on which electronic components are mounted and conductive traces are etched. PCBs provide connections and mechanical support for fundamental components, ICs, and more.

Development boards are commonly available for consumers to prototype with specific ICs by providing all the other components the IC requires.
